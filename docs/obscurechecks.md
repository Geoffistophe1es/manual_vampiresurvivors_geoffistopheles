# Obscure Checks
These are alternative, non-standard ways of reaching particular checks.

## Imelda Belpaese

* Holy Wand
* Photon Storm
* Prototype C
* Yagyu Shuriken
* Nitesco

## Poe Ratcho

## She-Moon Eeta

* Shadow Pinion
* Glass Fandango
* Prism Lass

## Santa Ladonna
If Santa Ladonna has a max level Santa Water, King Bible, and Cross, all three weapons disappear and she gains a hidden La Borra, Unholy Vesper, and Heaven Sword. This will not happen if any of the three are evolved before this condition is met, removing the need for their respective items. This adds the following logic checks:
* La Borra - Santa Ladonna and Santa Water and King Bible and Cross
* Unholy Vespers - Santa Ladonna and Santa Water and King Bible and Cross
* Heaven Sword - Santa Ladonna and Santa Water and King Bible and Cross

At level 40, an Arma Dio spawns, giving access to any evolution that does not require a fully leveled item. This requires the Early Arma Dio option to be set to be considered in logic.

## Juste Belmont
Juste Belmont has guaranteed access to the Belnades Spellbook up to level 7, and these weapons are leveled every 6 levels, even if the weapons or the Belnades Spellbook itself are sealed. This makes the evolution accessible through Juste with only the item unlocked. This affects the following checks:
* Salamender
* Cocytus
* Pneuma Tempestas
* Gemma Torpor
* Tenebris Tonitrus
* Keremet Morbus
* Nightmare
* Sanctuary

## Sara Trantoul
Sara Trantoul evolves the Alchemy Whip into the Vampire Killer upon revival. This adds the following options:
* Vampire Killer - (Star Flail or Sara Trantoul with Charactersanity) and (Alchemy Whip or Morning Star) and (Powerup - Revival or Tirajisu or Academy Badge or Weapon Power-Up or IV - Awake).
