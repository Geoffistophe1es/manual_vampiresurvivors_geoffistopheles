# Obscure Logic
These are alternative, non-standard ways of reaching particular checks. These are currently accounted for in logic.

## Max Level Tirajisu
With access to Ode to Castlevania and stage items included, there are two Tirajisu stage items to reach max level while sealed. One is at start, the other drops from Galamoth in the sewer.

## Max Level Passives with Two Levels
With access to a stage where one of these items exists as well as Arma Dio, you can pull the initial item from Arma Dio, then pick up the stage item to max it out. Currently this affects:
* Tirajisu
* Duplicator

## Imelda Belpaese
Completing the World of Light and Dark Adventure unlocks Unblinded Imelda Belpaese, who starts with a maxed Empty tome. This adds Magic Wand (or Imelda with Charactersanity) as a replacement for Empty Tome for the following logic checks:
* Holy Wand
* Photon Storm
* Prototype C
* Yagyu Shuriken
* Nitesco

## Poe Ratcho
Completing the Garlic Paradise Adventure unlocks Retired Poe Ratcho, who starts with a maxed Pummarola. This adds Garlic (or Poe with Charactersanity) as a replacement for Pummarola for the following logic checks:
* Soul Eater
* Festive Winds
* Moon Rod
* Sacred Beasts Tower Shield
* Triangle Kick

## She-Moon Eeta
Completing the To End an Ice Age Adventure unlocks Reborn She-Moon Eeta, who starts with a maxed Wings. This adds Glass Fandango (or She-Moon Eeta with Charactersanity) as a replacement for Wings for the following logic checks:
* Shadow Pinion
* Glass Fandango
* Prism Lass
* Alucard Spear
* Sonic Dash

## Santa Ladonna
If Santa Ladonna has a max level Santa Water, King Bible, and Cross, all three weapons disappear and she gains a hidden La Borra, Unholy Vesper, and Heaven Sword. This will not happen if any of the three are evolved before this condition is met, removing the need for their respective items. This adds the following logic checks:
* La Borra - Santa Ladonna and Santa Water and King Bible and Cross
* Unholy Vespers - Santa Ladonna and Santa Water and King Bible and Cross
* Heaven Sword - Santa Ladonna and Santa Water and King Bible and Cross

At level 40, an Arma Dio spawns, giving access to any evolution that does not require a fully leveled item. This requires the Early Arma Dio option to be set to be considered in logic.

## Juste Belmont
Juste Belmont has guaranteed access to the Belnades Spellbook up to level 7, and these weapons are leveled every 6 levels, even if the weapons or the Belnades Spellbook itself are sealed. This makes the evolution accessible through Juste with only the item unlocked. This affects the following checks:
* Salamender
* Cocytus
* Pneuma Tempestas
* Gemma Torpor
* Tenebris Tonitrus
* Keremet Morbus
* Nightmare
* Sanctuary

## Sara Trantoul
Sara Trantoul evolves the Alchemy Whip into the Vampire Killer upon revival. This adds the following options:
* Vampire Killer
* * Star Flail (or Sara Trantoul on Charactersanity)
* * Alchemy Whip, Morning Star, or Candybox
* * A means of reviving: Powerup - Revival or Tirajisu or Academy Badge or Weapon Power-Up or IV - Awake
