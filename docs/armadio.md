# Arma Dio
Arma Dio allows access to all passive items still available, even those that are sealed. Exceptions are Silver Ring, Gold Ring, Metaglio Left, Metaglio Right, Academy Badge, Weapon Power-Up, Outer Saboteur, all mini crewmates, and all familiars. Therefore, Arma Dio can be used to bypass item requirements so long as the item does not need to be max level.

For this to be in logic, the Early Arma Dio option must be selected in the YAML.

Arma Dio can be found:
* In Laborratory, entering enough rooms and hitting enough levers to spawn it (requires Include Stage Items option)
* In Neo Galuga (3) (requires Include Stage Items option)
* In Ode to Castlevania (4) (requires Include Stage Items option)
* Playing as Santa Ladonna, one spawns at level 40.
* Playing as Engineer Gino, the item selection screen appears at levels 2, 12, and 22.
* Darkana X - Hail from the Future has a chance to spawn an Arma Dio on level up.
