# Arma Dio
Arma Dio allows access to all passive items still available, even those sealed. Exceptions are Silver Ring, Gold Ring, Metaglio Left, Metaglio Right, Academy Badge, Weapon Power-Up, and all mini crewmates. Therefore, Arma Dio can be used to bypass item requirements so long as the item does not need to be max level.

Arma Dio can be found:
* In Laborratory, entering enough rooms and hitting enough levers to spawn it (requires Include Stage Items option)
* In Neo Galuga (3) (requires Include Stage Items option)
* In Ode to Castlevania (4) (requires Include Stage Items option)
* Playing as Santa Ladonna, one spawns at level 40 (requires Knowledge Checks option)
